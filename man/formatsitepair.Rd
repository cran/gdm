\title{
Converts Common Biological (Response) and Environmental (Predictor) Data Formats to a GDM Site-Pair Table
}
\description{
This function takes input biological and environmental data in various formats and builds a site-pair formatted table required for fitting a Generalized Dissimilarity Model using the \code{\link{gdm}} function. NOTE: Sample site x-y coordinates MUST be present in either the biological or the environmental data.

The input biological data can be in one of the following four formats (note that "species" can optionally be replaced by any other classification of biological entities - e.g. "functional types", "haplotypes"):

  1. site-species matrix

  2. x, y, species list

  3. site-site biological distance (dissimilarity) matrix

  4. an existing site-pair table (see Details)

Environmental (predictor) data can be provided in three formats:

  - a site-predictor matrix with a column for each predictor variable and a row for each site

  - a raster stack, with one raster for each predictor variable

  - one or more site-site distance predictor matrices using the "distPreds" argument (see below).

	YColumn, sppColumn=NULL, abundColumn=NULL, sppFilter=0, predData, distPreds=NULL,
	weightType="equal", custWeightVect=NULL, samples=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{bioData}{
The input biological (response) data table, in one of the four formats defined above (see Details).
}
  \item{bioFormat}{
An integer code specifying the format of bioData. Acceptable values are 1, 2, 3, or 4 (see Details).
}
  \item{dist}{
Default = "bray". A character code indicating the metric to quantify pairwise site distances / dissimilarities. Calls the \code{\link[vegan]{vegdist}} function from the \pkg{vegan} package to calculate dissimilarity and therefore accepts any method available from \code{\link[vegan]{vegdist}}.
}
  \item{abundance}{
Default = FALSE. Indicates whether the biological data are abundance data (TRUE) or presence-absence (0, 1) data (FALSE).
}
  \item{siteColumn}{
The name of the column in either the biological or environmental data table containing site codes/names. If a site column is provided in both the biological and environmental data, the column name must be identical.
}
  \item{XColumn}{
The name of the column containing x-coordinates of sample sites. X-coordinates can be provided in either the biological or environmental data tables, but MUST be in at least one of them. If an x-coordinate column is provided in both the biological and environmental data, the column name must be identical.
}
  \item{YColumn}{
The name of the column containing y-coordinates of sample sites. Y-coordinates can be provided in either the biological or environmental data tables, but MUST be in at least one of them. If a y-coordinate column is provided in both the biological and environmental data, the column name must be identical.
}
  \item{sppColumn}{
Only used if bioFormat = 2 (x, y, species list). The name of the column containing unique identifiers for each species. 
}
  \item{abundColumn}{
If abundance = TRUE, this parameter identifies the column containing the measure of abundance at each site. Only used if bioFormat = 2 (i.e., x, y, species list), though in the case of abundance data, the format would be: x, y, species, abundance.
}
  \item{sppFilter}{
Default = 0. To account for limited sampling effort at some sites, sppFilter removes all sites at which the number of recorded species (i.e., species richness) is less than the specified value. For example, if sppFilter = 5, all sites with fewer than 5 recorded species will be removed.
}
  \item{predData}{
The environmental predictor data. Accepts either a site-predictor matrix or a raster stack.
}
  \item{distPreds}{
A list of distance matrices to be used as predictors, either in combination with, or as a substitute for, predData. For example, pairwise dissimilarity for one biological group (e.g., trees) can be used as a predictor for another group (e.g., ferns). 
}
  \item{weightType}{
Default = "equal". Defines the weighting for sites. Can be either: (1) "equal" (weights for all sites set = 1), (2) "richness" (each site weighted according to number of species recorded), or (3) "custom" (user defined). If weightType="custom", the user must provide a vector of site weights equal to the number of rows in the full site-pair table (i.e., before species filtering or sub-sampling is taken into account).
}
  \item{custWeightVect}{
A vector of user-defined site weights. Required when weightType = "custom". Ignored otherwise. 
}
  \item{samples}{
Default = NULL. The maximum number of site-pairs to be included in the output site-pair table. The function first constructs the full site-pair table. Then, if the value of the samples parameter is a less than or equal to the number of rows available in the site-pair table, a new table is created with randomly selected rows from the original table.
}
}
\details{
bioData and bioFormat: The function accepts biological data in the following formats:

bioData = site-species matrix; bioFormat = 1: assumes that the response data are provided with a site ID column (specified by siteCol) and, optionally, two columns for the x & y coordinates of the sites. All remaining columns contain the biological data, with a column for each biological entity (most commonly species). In the case that a raster stack is provided for the environmental data (predData), x-y coordinates MUST be provided in bioData to allow extraction of the environmental data at site locations. The x-y coordinates will be intersected with the raster stack and, if the number of unique cells intersected by the points is less than the number of unique site IDs (i.e. multiple sites fall within a single cell), the function will use the raster cell as the site ID and aggregate sites accordingly. Therefore, model fitting will be sensitive to raster cell size. If the environmental data are in tabular format, they should have the same number of sites (i.e., same number of rows) as bioData. The x-y coordinate and site ID columns must have the same names in bioData and predData.

bioData = x, y, species list (optionally a fourth column with abundance can be provided); bioFormat = 2: assumes a table of 3 or 4 columns, the first two being the x & y coordinates of species records, the third (sppCol) being the name of the species observed at that location, and optionally a fourth column indicating a measure of abundance.  If an abundance column is not provided, presence-only data are assumed. In the case that a raster stack is provided for the environmental data (predData), the x-y coordinates will be intersected with the raster stack and, if the number of unique cells intersected by the points is less than the number of unique site IDs (i.e. multiple sites fall within a single cell), the function will use the raster cell as the site ID and aggregate sites accordingly. Therefore, model fitting will be sensitive to raster cell size.

bioData = site-site distance (dissimilarity) matrix; bioFormat = 3: is used when a site-site distance (dissimilarity) matrix has already been created for the biological response (e.g., Fst for genetic data). Only the lower half (triangle) of the matrix is needed to create the site-pair output table, but this function automatically removes the upper half if present. This is the only case in which the environmental data CANNOT be provided as a raster stack.

bioData = site-pair able; bioFormat = 4: with an already created site-pair table, this option allows for one to add one or more distance matrices (see distPreds above) to the table and/or sub-sample the table (see sample above).

NOTE: The function assumes that the x-y coordinates and the raster stack (if used) are in the same coordinate system. No checking is performed to confirm this is the case.

\value{
A site-pair formatted table containing the response (biological distance or dissimilarity), predictors, and weights as required for fitting Generalized Dissimilarity Models.
